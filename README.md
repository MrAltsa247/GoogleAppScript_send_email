# GoogleAppScript_send_email
This Google Apps Script automates email sending using Gmail based on a structured Google Sheet. Each row contains the recipient’s email address, subject, body, and an optional Google Drive link. If the Drive link is provided, the file will be attached directly to the email—not just included as a link.
