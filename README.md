ðŸ“‹ Overview
This Google Apps Script automates email sending using Gmail based on a structured Google Sheet. Each row contains the recipientâ€™s email address, subject, body, and an optional Google Drive link. If the Drive link is provided, the file will be attached directly to the emailâ€”not just included as a link.
